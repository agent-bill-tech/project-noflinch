          No Flinch is a 4-piece band forged from raw energy and unrelenting sound.
          With roots in heavy rock and an edge that cuts through the noise,
          the band delivers a visceral live experience that leaves no one standing still.

          Their debut single "Hunt You Down" set the tone — dark, driving, and impossible
